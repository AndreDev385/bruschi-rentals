			"Where do I begin ? By chance I found Paulina from a posting on Facebook and she exceeded my expectations. She worked day in and day out (literally because I was looking for something super specific!) until she found the perfect unit for me. She was super supportive, very personable, and just a lovely professional individual. I am so happy I was able to work with her and I highly recommend her. She will literally consider everything on your wishlist and find a perfect spot.",

Vivía en otro estado, y gracias a su profesionalismo, todo el proceso de búsqueda de apartamentos y mudanza fue mucho más sencillo. Escuchó atentamente mis necesidades y me ofreció opciones perfectas, gestionando todo de manera eficiente. Su comunicación fue constante y clara, lo que me dio mucha confianza. Gracias a ella, mi mudanza fue mucho más ligera y sin complicaciones. La recomiendo sin dudarlo a cualquiera que necesite un excelente servicio inmobiliario.",

Planning a move from California to Miami required a lot of coordination and open communication, Paulina was there at every point providing advice and her sharing her expertise. If you are looking for an experienced professional who goes above and beyond and puts her clients first, I highly recommend working with Paulina!",

			"I would give Paulina 20 stars if I could! She has been nothing short of spectacular. My husband and our family just relocated from another state and Paulina held our hands the entire way. Early on in the process before the move was confirmed she took our information and what we were looking for, keeping an eye out for what would fit. Answering 101 questions without even knowing if we would be moving forsure. She made sure that we were aware of everything we needed when the time came to secure an apartment, ready and prepared. She had multiple options ready for us when we confirmed we would be relocating. Offered pictures, videos tours, special pricing for that month, and had every detail we wanted to consider accounted for. She assisted day of move in, checked in multiple times afterwards and was genuinely just such a joy to work with. You can tell she loves what she does and  it felt like she was also moving with us with how excited and supportive she was. We love our new spot it fits everything we wanted and not a drop of sweat or stress happened because of Paulina. If for some reason we ever have to relocate we will absolutely be reaching out again. If you’re looking for someone to be detail oriented, responsive, knowledgeable, and truly just be in your corner- Call Paulina!",
